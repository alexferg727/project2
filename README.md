# project2

I messed up on the tagging it seems, 

if you go to my previous commits, milestone is v0.1.0 and threadpool is v0.2.0

ALSO: THERES AN EQUALS SIGN LINE 213, please get rid of it my github is complaining and not letting me commit 1 backspace change, weird. WILL TRY AGAIN TOMORROW

I put a lot of effort and brainpower into this.
